ESP12E & Sensors(Tilt sensor, Raindrop Sensor, Flame Sensor).

ESP12E=>> 
  ESP12E is ESP8266 12E wifi module, used for various purposes like Wifi networking, connect to internet to fetch or upload data. It combined features of WIFI accesspoint and station + microcontroller and uses simple LUA based programming language. 
  
Tilt Sensor=>>
  Used to calculate vibration. Output of Tilt sensor to be used as measurement of vibration caused due to natural disasters like earth quakes, cyclone, flood,etc or even because of train or heavy vehicles transport near building.
 
Raindrop Sensor=>>
  Raindrop sensor is used for purpose to know if any leakage or to check the reason if building is been damaging because of water.
  
Flame Sensor=>>
  Flame sensor in this system is used to alert if any fire or radiations causing damage to building.
